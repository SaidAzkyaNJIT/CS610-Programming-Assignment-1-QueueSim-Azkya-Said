    "The simulation is currently setup for 100 minutes, 1 customer per minute arriving on average, and a service time of 5 days. Different parameters were tested, and these were selected for ease of analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fastest System: The single queue system appears to be the fastest, completing the simulation in a shorter duration compared to the multiple queue scenarios. This is because all three service stations can potentially be utilized simultaneously in a single queue system, whereas multiple queues can lead to idle stations if one queue is empty while others are still populated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Queue Lengths and Waiting Times: While the multiple queue systems had shorter average queue lengths compared to the single queue, they exhibited slightly longer average waiting times. This can be attributed to the fact that even with shorter queues, customers may still need to wait for a specific service station to become available in the multiple queue scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Queue Strategies: Among the multiple queue strategies, round-robin tends to perform the best due to its balanced distribution of customers across the queues. Random assignment can lead to the worst performance due to the possibility of uneven queue buildup if customers are repeatedly assigned to the same queue. The rate of occupancy was also more consistent across the 3 service stations for the round robin. This shows that round robin was the most efficient of the multiple queuing startegies. \n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this simulation, a single queue system seems to be more efficient in terms of overall throughput (duration) and potentially customer satisfaction (shorter maximum waiting times). However, if multiple queues are necessary due to factors like service specialization or physical constraints, a round-robin assignment strategy is likely to yield the best results among the multiple queue options. The choice between single and multiple queues may depend on additional factors not considered in this simulation, such as customer preferences, the nature of the services being offered, and the physical layout of the service area."
